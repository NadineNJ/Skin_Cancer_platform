# ü©∫ Skin Cancer Detection Platform

This project is a full-stack web application that uses deep learning to detect skin cancer types from uploaded images. The system provides a medical-style report based on the image analysis.

- Frontend: Angular
- Backend: Flask (with a trained CNN model)
- Output: Predicted class, confidence, definition, and report

## üìä Dataset Info

The model was trained using the [Skin Cancer 9 Classes ISIC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic/data) from Kaggle.

This dataset contains **9 distinct skin cancer types**, with images labeled and organized for classification:

- **Actinic Keratoses (AKIEC)**
- **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
- **Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL)**
- **Dermatofibroma (DF)**
- **Melanocytic Nevi (NV)**
- **Vascular Lesions (VASC)**
- **Melanoma (MEL)**
- **Pigmented Benign Keratosis (PBK)**
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**

> The dataset was cleaned, resized, normalized, and balanced before training the model.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Node.js 16+ and Angular CLI  
- **tfenv** (TensorFlow version manager) for frontend TensorFlow version control (optional but recommended)

---

## Run the Flask Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py

The backend will be available at http://localhost:5000/.

---

üåê Run the Angular Frontend
cd frontend

# If using tfenv (recommended):
tfenv install 2.19.0
tfenv use 2.19.0

npm install
ng serve

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:4200/.
Make sure the backend is running before using the frontend.
